"""
scripts/check_builder_css.py
============================

Guard rails for the extracted Prompt Builder styles and markup.

The builder is embedded in two pages, so its CSS has to be scoped and its
ids have to be unique across every host. Both are easy to break with a
one-line edit and impossible to notice by eye - an unscoped `button` rule
does not look wrong in builder.css, it only shows up as a restyled
control on a page nobody was editing.

Run it directly, or let the test suite pick it up:

    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts\\check_builder_css.py

Exits non-zero and prints what it found.
