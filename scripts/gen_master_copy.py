gen_master_copy.py
==================

Deterministic documentation generator for this repository.

Writes three documents into ``source_files/``:

    APP_CODE_SNAPSHOT.md            <- the whole repository, verbatim, one place
    novous.md                       <- a separately named whole-repository snapshot
    headless_app_MASTER_COPY.md     <- headless_app/ structure + module reference

The three documents divide the work so that an AI (or a person) can answer any
question about the code, and rebuild it, from the ``source_files/`` folder
alone:

* the **snapshot** is a copy. Every source file, byte for byte, behind one
  file structure. It deliberately says nothing about what the code does.
* the **master copy** is a map. File structure plus a description of
  every module, class and function, auto-extracted from the live tree. They
  deliberately contain no file bodies.

Run:
    .venv/Scripts/python -m scripts.gen_master_copy
    .venv/Scripts/python -m scripts.gen_master_copy --only headless_app

The prose lives in this file (the PREAMBLE and OVERVIEW sections) so that a
regeneration is fully deterministic: the same tree always produces the same
documents, byte for byte, apart from the date stamp.

Design rules
------------
1. Three generated documents: two whole-repository snapshots and one master
   copy.
2. No self-embedding. A document is never embedded in itself or in a
   sibling, so the output cannot nest.
3. Adaptive fences. Each file's fence is one backtick longer than the
   longest run of backticks inside that file, so content containing ``` fences
   (README.md, HTML pages) still renders correctly.
4. Deterministic order. Files are sorted case-insensitively by their
   root-relative path.
5. One name for the app. ``APP_NAME`` is the only name used for the project.
   :data:`LEGACY_NAME_RE` names the retired names; any occurrence found in
   the tree is reported on stderr so they cannot quietly return. The
   generator skips itself, because it is the one file that has to spell the
   retired names in order to search for them.

## What This Is

A verbatim copy of every source file in this repository, in one document,
behind one file structure. It exists for reference and AI lookup: to answer a
question about the code, or to rebuild it, the exact bytes of every file plus a
map of where everything lives are what is needed, and that is what this
document is.

There is deliberately **no description of what the code does here**. That
lives in the companion document, which describes the agent engine module by
module:

- [`headless_app_MASTER_COPY.md`](headless_app_MASTER_COPY.md) — the agent
  engine, its tools and its bridge.

Read the master copy to learn what a file is for, then come here for its
contents. The File Index below is sized so you can also jump straight to one
file and read only that.

---

## Boot Sequence

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer. The virtual environment in this workspace is 3.14.
- Ollama running locally, with at least one model pulled. The picker list in
  `headless_app/config/models.json` names `llama3.1:8b`,
  `nomic-embed-text:latest`, `qwen2.5-coder:latest` and `gemma4:e2b`.
- A web browser. The interface is static HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript —
  there is no build step and no bundler.

### Create the environment and run

```bat
rem 1. Virtual environment at the repository root, shared by both halves.
scripts\\venv.bat

rem 2. Dependencies. requirements.txt pins the server stack. The engine also
rem    needs ollama and pydantic, which venv.bat installs for you.
.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt

rem 3. Start the web app: the editor, chat page and agent routes are served
rem    by this one process.
.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe server.py
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. The bind address and port come from
`PROJECT_MANAGER_HOST` and `PROJECT_MANAGER_PORT` (the repository-root
`server.py`).
The engine also runs without the server:

```bat
cd headless_app
..\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe run.py list-agents
..\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe run.py run-agent rag_assistant --message "what date is it today?"
```

### Layout requirement

The repository-root `server.py` imports the engine by putting
`<repo>/headless_app` on `sys.path`; the chat and agent routers also resolve
that path relative to their files.

# ============================================================
# OVERVIEW — HEADLESS APP
# ============================================================

def headless_app_overview() -> str:
    return """\
## Overview

`headless_app/` is the **agent half** of agentCreator. The repository-root
`server.py` hosts the editor and server interface and imports this package
directly — so there is no agent server, no second port, and no HTTP hop
between the UI and the model. Both halves run in one process.

| Component             | Role                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `engine/`             | The think → act → observe runtime, prompt builder, agent loader/registry/factory, pipeline chain |
| `tools/`              | Tool registry, `FileSession` state, chat log, and the file tools that reach the Project Manager |
| `bridge/`             | Project Manager connection layer: sync + async HTTP clients, `DirectProjectIO`, drop-in routers |
| `config/`             | `models.json` (the model picker) and `pipeline.json` (the default cascade) |
| `interface_runner.py` | Programmatic entry point — `AgentInterface`                                |
| `run.py`              | Command-line entry point                                                   |

The `engine/agent_library/` subfolders are agent definitions, not code
modules: each holds an `agent.json` (metadata) and an `agent.md` (the prompt
whose `## role` / `## purpose` sections are folded into the system prompt).
They are described in the Module Reference like every other file.

---

## Entry Points

### `run.py` — command line

```text
python run.py list-agents
python run.py refresh-models
python run.py run-agent rag_assistant --message "what date is it today?"
python run.py run-pipeline --message "idea: add a settings screen" \\
    --steps rag_assistant execute_engineer_agent module_builder_agent
```

Useful flags: `--base-url` (Project Manager URL, default
`$PROJECT_MANAGER_BASE_URL` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`), `--no-bridge` (skip
the bridge and fall back to local-disk tools), and `-m/--model` (override the
agent's own `agent.json` model).

### `interface_runner.py` — programmatic

`AgentInterface` is the thin, stable API over the engine, and the single seam
every caller goes through — the CLI, the Project Manager routers, and any
Python script — so build/think/log behaviour cannot drift between frontends.

| Method                                    | Purpose                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run_chat(message, agent_id)`             | One registered agent from any registered root; returns a chat reply                        |
| `run_single_agent(json_path, md_path, ui)` | One ad-hoc agent built from explicit `agent.json` + `agent.md` paths                          |
| `run_pipeline(agent_configs, user_input)` | Ordered feed-forward chain; each step receives the original message plus every earlier reply |

Every run persists the user turn and the reply to `data/chatlog/chat.log` (so
history survives reloads and an agent's `search_chat_logs` tool can recall it)
and records tool events to `data/toollog/tool_usage.jsonl`.

---

## How Project Manager Embeds This Package

`interface/routers/chat.py` and
`interface/routers/agents.py` each call a small guard,
`_ensure_headless_on_path()`, which resolves `headless_app/` relative to the
router's own location and puts it on `sys.path`. Because the router sits three
levels below the repository root, that is `<repo>/headless_app`. The same
helper in `bridge/routers/` resolves `parents[2]` instead, which is why
`bridge/routers/chat.py` and `bridge/routers/agents.py` are **drop-in
routers** — distributable copies of the Project Manager routers, importable as
`bridge.routers.*`. No server in this repository mounts them; the live
endpoints are the ones under `interface/routers/`.

---

## Think → Act → Observe

`engine/core/agent.py` runs one agent per request:

1. `think(user_input)` inserts the system prompt (if absent) and injects a
   `CURRENT FILE SESSION STATE` block, then calls `ask_llm()`.
2. Native `tool_calls` are used when the model supports them; otherwise
   plain-text JSON tool calls are parsed out of the content.
3. Each round calls `act(tool_call, origin)` — normalize the arguments, run
   the tool, record a `tool_events` entry, classify it as success / error /
   missing — followed by `observe(name, result)`, which appends a
   `{"role": "tool", ...}` history entry.
4. The loop is bounded. `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS = 6` caps the rounds, and
   `REPEAT_LIMIT = 3` trips a guard when an order-independent fingerprint of
   the tool calls repeats three times: the agent is told to stop calling tools
   and answer in plain text, and if it still will not, the loop ends with
   `(The agent kept repeating the same tool call and stopped answering in
   text. Please rephrase your request or ask again.)`
5. A blank final reply falls back to
   `(I ran my tools but did not produce a final answer. Please ask again.)`

`chat` mode attaches no tools at all, so no tool loop can occur. Tool-armed
agents get a grounding block from `engine/agents/factory.py` pinning a real
`WORKSPACE ROOT`, the agent's own folder, and the skills directory, so file
paths are never guessed.

`engine/pipeline.py::run_pipeline` chains agents: every step receives the
original message plus all earlier replies, the last reply is the result, and
the run is appended to `data/pipeline_runs.jsonl` (fail-safe — a logging error
never fails the run).

```text
User -> build_agent(agent_id, model)          agents/factory.py
  -> Agent.think(message)                     core/agent.py
       -> ask_llm(messages, model, tools)     core/llm.py -> Ollama
       -> [tool_calls?]
            -> act(call)     tool runs, event recorded
            -> observe(name, result)
            -> ask_llm(...) again
            (max 6 rounds, repeat-guarded)
       -> reply
```

### The tools

`tools/project_tools.py` holds every executable tool, one function each. The
function's **docstring is what the model sees**: `PromptManager` turns its
first line into the system prompt's AVAILABLE TOOLS section, and Ollama derives
the JSON schema from the name, signature and types.

| Tool id                      | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `map_files`                  | Map a directory tree                              |
| `read_file`                  | Read a workspace file                             |
| `write_text_file`            | Create or overwrite a workspace file              |
| `delete_files`               | Delete files, behind a two-step approval protocol  |
| `get_current_date`           | Today's date                                      |
| `tell_me_the_date_and_time`  | Current date and time                             |
| `search_chat_logs`           | Recall the agent's own chat history               |

File tools run against one of three backends, chosen once via `configure()`:
a Project Manager bridge over HTTP, a **direct** in-process Project Manager
provider (`DirectProjectIO`, used when mounted inside Project Manager), or the
local disk when no provider is configured. Whatever the backend, it exposes the
same small surface — `workspace_root`, `relpath()`, `list_tree()`, `read()`,
`write()`, `create()`, `delete()`, `exists()`.

---

## Agents and configuration

`engine/agent_library/<folder>/` holds an `agent.json` and an `agent.md`. The
folder name is for humans; `agent.json#id` is the id you select in the UI and
pass to `/api/agents/run`. Roots are registered with
`engine/agents/roots.py` — `engine/agent_library/` at import time, and
`workspace/agents/` when the Project Manager starts — and searched
most-recently-registered first, so a workspace agent shadows a library agent
with the same id.

| Folder          | `agent.json#id`           | Mode    | Model                    | Tools                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `rag_assistant` | `rag_assistant`          | `agent` | `gemma4:e2b`             | map, read, write, delete, date, search_chat_logs |
| `Planner`       | `feature_planner_agent`  | `chat`  | `qwen2.5-coder:latest`   | none — `chat` mode takes no tools |
| `Enginner`      | `execute_engineer_agent` | `agent` | `qwen2.5-coder:latest`   | `read_file`                  |
| `Builder`       | `module_builder_agent`   | `agent` | `qwen2.5-coder:latest`   | map, read, write             |

- `config/models.json` — the models offered by the UI picker, each with `id`,
  `name`, `source` and `size`. `refresh_models` re-scans the local Ollama
  install.
- `config/pipeline.json` — the default `module-generation` cascade:
  `feature_planner_agent` → `execute_engineer_agent` →
  `module_builder_agent`, served by `GET /api/pipeline`.

Model and context bounds live in `engine/core/llm.py` (`MAX_NUM_CTX = 32768`).
Failure behaviour is deliberate rather than fatal: an unknown agent id returns
an error string, a model that is not installed falls back to a detected one
with a warning, and a model that does not support tools has its schemas dropped
so the agent answers text-only.
