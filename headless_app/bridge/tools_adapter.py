"""
bridge/tools_adapter.py
=======================

Maps the headless agent tools to their Project Manager HTTP surface and
binds a bridge to the tool registry.

The tools themselves live in tools/project_tools.py and branch on the
configured provider; this module is the wiring point that turns a bridge
(or direct provider) into the active filesystem authority for all agents
built afterwards.

TOOL_ENDPOINT_MAP documents, for each tool id, the Project Manager endpoint
the tool ultimately drives when a bridge is connected.
